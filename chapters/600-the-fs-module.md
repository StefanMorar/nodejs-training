Goal: Know how to use the most common file system operations in Node.js.

Required Reading:

 - [Node.js: File System APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system)
 - [File Uploading](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/file-upload)
 - [File Streaming](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/streaming-files)

Online Shop: 

 > Use the file system to store and then serve images for the products. These images should be stored in a git-ignored `tmp` folder inside your project. Create dedicated APIs for:
 > - Uploading a new image for a product (by id),
 > - Remove the image of a product,
 > - Retrieve the image of a product (by id) - here you should use Streams,
 > - List all images.
 >
 > Of course, when a product is deleted, it's corresponding image should also be deleted if it exists.
