> Create a module for the entities you will use (categories and products). You will design them using the MVC pattern, thus each module will have:
 > - models
 > - DTOs
 > - repository (for now store the data within an array of objects, later chapters will improve on this)
 > - service
 > - controller
 
> Create a simple API for exposing the products and product categories, supporting the following operations:
 > - Reading all categories,
 > - Reading all products in a given category (by id),
 > - Reading a given product by id,
 > - Creating a new product in a given category (by id),
 > - Updating a product by id
 > - Deleting a product by id
 >
 > Test these APIs using Postman.
