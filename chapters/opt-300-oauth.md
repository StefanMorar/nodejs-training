# OAuth
  
**Goal:**
- Secure the online shop with OAuth 2.0.

## Mandatory Materials:

**Reading:**
- [The Simplest Guide to OAuth 2.0](https://medium.com/@darutk/the-simplest-guide-to-oauth-2-0-8c71bd9a15bb)
- [Spotify OAuth2 Authentication in a NestJS Application](https://betterprogramming.pub/spotify-oauth2-authentication-in-a-nestjs-application-307b25b2e49e)
  
## Online Shop:
> Configure your application as an Authorization Server with an in-memory store of clients. Use Postman to test that you are able to issue a token using the password grant.

> Now also configure your application as a Resource Server and secure your REST APIs using OAuth.

> Lastly, enable your application to additionally use the [GitHub Authorization Server](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/). To do this, you will first need to register a new OAuth app on GitHub or contact the trainers for obtaining the credentials of an existing client.
